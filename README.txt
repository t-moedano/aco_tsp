# aco_tsp
A simple implementation of Ant Colony Optmization to resolve TSP problem. 
In main.c you will find the variables n and vertices. You can change them
to the number of vertices in your graph.

Furthermore, you can chance any parameter (a, b, p, number of antes, number of iterations)
to produce differents results. 

In aco.h you will in the function "IniciarPesoFeromonio" a file with the vertices. You can chance this file.
It's just an example. The file needs to follow a specific format. You just need to imput the weights
between each vertice excluding the main diagonal. 

There some files in txt to you test. Rember chance n and vertices.
